#============================== Syntax of Steps ================================
#   - name: something 
#           creates a new step with name 'something' when displayed on github
#
#     run:  this run will appear inside 'something' (on github) because,
#           it doesn't have a '-' at the beginning
#           use: same as run, will appear inside 'something' on github
#
# *   an object appearing inside 'steps:' after '- name:' will
#     appear inside '- name:' when displayed on github
#
#   - run: This run will be treated as an independent step
#          that means it will not appear inside 'something'
#          because it has a '-' before it
# *   an object that begins with a '-' (after steps:)
#     will appear inside steps as an independent step of the job
#
#     Q: What is a step?
#     Ans: Undefined
#
#       Probably any object that show up on github (when starting with '-')
#       In that case maybe one can call objects that don't start with '-'
#       a sub step ---> Not sure about this
#       For instance: 'run:' inside '- name:' here 'run:' is the substep
#       this sub step thing doesn't matter
#       named Steps are useful for only making debugging the actions easier
#       for the same reason named job is also nice to have
#       ;)
